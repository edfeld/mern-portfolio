                            I am a full stack developer with a broad range of software development experience. I really enjoy learning new things. I have recently graduated from the UW coding bootcamp where I have been honing my web development skills in javascript, and the MERN stack.

                            My last position was with a health care service organization.  My business unit supported a tobacco cessation program.  I worked as a software developer on the customer relationship management system that support the cessation program. The program was primarily driven through phone based coaching and online learning. I am deeply grateful for having been part of a business that impacted so many lives.

                            I live in the charming community of Brier, Washington north of Seattle, near the top of lake Washington. I can juggle and ride a unicycle, but not at the same time. I am passionate about staying in shape with hiking and cycling. I organize hikes for my friends and family. I am an above average rec room ping pong player.
